Command-line Unicode map

Usage
-----

It's a good idea to symlink `uni.py` to `uni` on your path (or alias or w/e).

* `uni snow` - search for characters with `snow` in the name
* `uni -1 snow` - print the first `snow` character
* `uni -c1 snow` - print the first `snow` character, the character only

Development
-----------

Run `make` to download and process new Unicode data.
